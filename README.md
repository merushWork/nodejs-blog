# Nodejs-blog

### Details:

The project is a backend implementation of a news application with blog-like functionality, built using Node.js and Express. The application will provide CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing news posts. Data will be stored in MongoDB using Mongoose for data modeling.
Other technologies: EJS (for templating), Mongoose (for MongoDB integration).

### Functionality:

1. Basic Concepts & Setup:
  - Setting up the project environment using Node.js and Express.
  - Understanding the structure and components of the application.
2. Global Objects & Modules:
  - Utilizing Node.js built-in global objects.
  - Managing modules using the require and module.exports methods.
3. File System Integration:
  - Implementing file handling operations like reading, writing, and managing media files (e.g., images for posts).
4. Event Handling:
  - Leveraging event-driven programming in Node.js (if applicable to logging or background tasks).
5. Create Server:
  - Setting up an HTTP server using Node.js and Express to handle incoming requests for CRUD operations.
6. Routing:
  - Defining routes for the application:
    - GET route for reading posts.
    - POST route for creating posts.
    - PUT route for updating posts.
    - DELETE route for deleting posts.
7. Handling POST Requests:
  - Processing form data submitted through the client-side and handling new post creation via POST requests.
8. MongoDB Integration:
  - Connecting the application to MongoDB using Mongoose.
  - Defining schemas and models to represent news posts and comments.
9. Get & Post Requests:
  - Fetching data from MongoDB and rendering it on the client side.
  - Allowing users to submit new posts through forms and store them in the database.
10. Delete & Update Requests:
  - Implementing the functionality to edit or delete existing news posts through PUT and DELETE HTTP requests.
11. Middleware:
  - Using Express middleware for request logging, body parsing, and error handling.
  - Using morgan for request logging and method-override for handling PUT/DELETE requests via forms.
12. MVC & Router:
  - Structuring the application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to separate concerns.
  - Implementing Express Router to handle different routes efficiently.
13. API Creation:
  - Setting up RESTful API endpoints for managing news posts and comments.
  - Testing the API using Postman.
  - Using Express middleware for request logging, body parsing, and error handling.
